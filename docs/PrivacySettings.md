# Privacy Settings guide

## Just tell me what to do.

Modify your Destiny Privacy settings [here](https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/Settings) and enable _Show my Progression_ and save by clicking save.

## Wow there, explain yourself here.

To accomplish is job, Discord-Ghost needs to have access to your latest activites.

Normally, you would authorize DiscordGhost to do so through a login process, with Bungie warning you about it and asking if you're sure (in tech slang, we need to OAuth with the proper scope).

Problem, we didn't realize that until now, and to develop this feature will take time, and we know that you may want to use DiscordGhost in the mean time. So, by making those data publicly available, the app is able to get it and work normally.

So, this is a **temporary** workaround to a blocking issue, **we will fix it** properly in the near future.
